# Day 4 – Mini Projects (Python)

Today I worked on two small Python projects as part of my placement training.
The focus was on applying basic Python concepts to real-world style problems.

## Projects

### 1. ATM Simulation
- Simulates basic ATM operations
- Features include balance check, withdraw, deposit, and exit
- Uses conditional statements, loops, and functions

### 2. Quiz Game
- Console-based quiz application
- Uses lists for questions and answers
- Implements scoring system
- Stores and compares high score using file handling

## Learning Outcome
This day helped me understand how to structure small projects,
use functions effectively, and apply file handling in real scenarios.
