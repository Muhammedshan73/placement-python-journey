# Day 3 – Python Recap & Exception Handling

Today’s practice focused on revising Python data structures and understanding
exception handling with real examples. I also solved multiple logic-based
practice questions to improve problem-solving skills.

## Topics Practiced
- List operations (append, removing duplicates, sum of elements)
- Conversions between:
  - List ↔ Tuple
  - List ↔ Set
  - Set ↔ Dictionary
- Exception handling:
  - try, except, else, finally
  - Handling specific errors (ZeroDivisionError, ValueError)
  - Raising exceptions using raise
  - Custom exceptions
- Control flow with for-else and nested try blocks
- Function behavior with return and exception flow

## Practice Problems
- Remove duplicate elements from a list
- Move all zeros to the end of a list
- Reverse and palindrome checking
- Find longest word in a sentence
- Subarray sum count
- Two-sum problem (brute force & two-pointer approach)
- Middle element using slow and fast pointer logic

## Learning Outcome
This day helped me clearly understand how Python handles errors,
data type conversions, and how logic behaves inside loops, functions,
and exception blocks.
