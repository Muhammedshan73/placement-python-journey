# Day 6 – Python OOP (Inheritance & Polymorphism)

Today I learned and practiced advanced Object-Oriented Programming concepts
in Python, mainly inheritance and polymorphism, using multiple real-world examples.

## Concepts Covered
- Inheritance (parent and child classes)
- Single inheritance
- Multiple inheritance
- Method overriding
- Using `super()` to call parent constructor
- Accessing parent class methods
- Protected (`_`) and private (`__`) members
- Getter methods for private variables
- Diamond problem and method resolution order (MRO)
- Polymorphism using common method names

## Practice Examples
- Parent–Child class relationship
- Animal and Dog behavior
- Mobile phone inheritance example
- Constructor chaining using `super()`
- Method overriding examples
- Multiple inheritance (Father–Mother–Child)
- ATM / Bank account example using inheritance
- Polymorphism using `speak()` and `ride()` methods
- Role-based behavior using polymorphism

## Learning Outcome
This day helped me understand how Python supports code reuse through inheritance,
how child classes override parent behavior, and how polymorphism allows
different objects to respond differently to the same method call.
