# Day 5 – Python OOP (Classes & Objects)

Today I learned and practiced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python.
The focus was on understanding how classes, objects, constructors, and methods work
using simple real-life examples.

## Concepts Covered
- Creating classes and objects
- Constructors (`__init__`)
- Instance variables and class variables
- Using `self` keyword
- Accessing object properties
- Modifying instance and class-level data
- Methods inside a class
- Static methods
- Encapsulation (public, protected, private variables)
- Getter and setter methods

## Practice Examples
- Student class with name and marks
- Car class with model and color
- Employee and Company examples
- Using class variables shared across objects
- Counting total number of objects created
- ATM simulation using private balance
- Deposit and withdraw functionality
- Bank balance example using getters and setters

## Learning Outcome
This day helped me clearly understand how real-world entities
can be represented using classes and objects in Python,
and how data hiding and access control works.
